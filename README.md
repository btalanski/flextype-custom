## About
This is a fork of Flextype CMS an open-source Hybrid Content Management System. The intent is to customize the application to fit the needs of my own projects.

I suggest not using this as your starting template due to the customizations applied to the original source code. Fork or clone your own version of Flextype from the following repo: [https://github.com/flextype/flextype](https://github.com/flextype/flextype)
